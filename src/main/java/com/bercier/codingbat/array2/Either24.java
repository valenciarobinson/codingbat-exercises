        In this approach we:
            1. pass through all numbers that are part of a pair of 2's or pair of 4's as currentValue
            2. turned every number that not's part of a pair of 2's or 4's into a -1 in the resultant list
                a. The purpose is to get to a normalized list of numbers that we can interpret into
                    one of the 3 desired outcomes
            4. remove all -1's; they are not needed
            6. take a count of how many records are in the resulting stream
            5. The outcomes will be:
                a. 0 which means there were no pairs of 2's or pairs of 4's
                b. 1 which means there were at least one pair of 2's and not pairs of 4's or vice versa
                c. greater than 1 which means that there were:
                    i. pairs of 2's and pair's of 4's
                    ii. no pairs of 2's or pairs of 4's

                if the element count is 0 return false; no 2's or 4's
                if the element count is 1 return true; either 2's or 4's
                if the element count is anything else then return false because we know that we had:
